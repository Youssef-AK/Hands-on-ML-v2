Some Explanations from our analysis :\n- **Product ID** *product quality* variants and a variant-specific serial number\n- **Type** Product Quality [L, M, H]\n- **Air temperature [K]**  normalized to a standard deviation of 2 K around 300 K\n- **Process temperature [K]** normalized to a standard deviation of 1 K, added to the air temperature plus 10 K.\n- **Rotational speed [rpm]** calculated from a power of 2860 W, overlaid with a normally distributed noise\n- **Torque [Nm]** normally distributed around 40 Nm with a σ = 10 Nm and *no negative values*\n- **Tool wear [min]** The quality variants H/M/L add 5/3/2 minutes of tool wear to the used tool in the process.\n- **Machine failure** indicates whether the machine has failed in this particular datapoint, consists of five independent failure modes:\n- **TWF** (tool wear failure): the tool will be replaced or fail at a randomly selected tool wear time between 200 – 240 mins (**120** times in our dataset). At this point in time, the tool is **replaced 74** times, and **fails 46** times (randomly assigned).\n- **HDF** (heat dissipation failure) heat dissipation causes a process failure, if the difference between air-and process temperature is below 8.6 K and the tool’s rotational speed is below 1380 rpm. This is the case for **115** data points\n- **PWF** (power failure) the product of torque and rotational speed (in rad/s) equals the power required for the process. If this power is below 3500 W or above 9000 W, the process fails, which is the case **95** times in our dataset.\n- **OSF** (overstrain failure) if the product of tool wear and torque exceeds 11,000 minNm for the L product variant (12,000 for M, 13,000 for H), the process fails due to overstrain. This is true for **98** datapoints\n- **RNF** (random failure) each process has a chance of 0,1 % to fail regardless of its process parameters. This is the case for **19** datapoints, more frequent than *could be expected* for 10,000 datapoints in our dataset.","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"## Data
